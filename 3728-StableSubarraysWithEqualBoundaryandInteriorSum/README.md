You are given an integer array capacity.

A subarray capacity[l..r] is considered stable if:


	Its length is at least 3.
	The first and last elements are each equal to the sum of all elements strictly between them (i.e., capacity[l] = capacity[r] = capacity[l + 1] + capacity[l + 2] + ... + capacity[r - 1]).


Return an integer denoting the number of stable subarrays.

 
Example 1:


Input: capacity = [9,3,3,3,9]

Output: 2

Explanation:


	[9,3,3,3,9] is stable because the first and last elements are both 9, and the sum of the elements strictly between them is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9.
	[3,3,3] is stable because the first and last elements are both 3, and the sum of the elements strictly between them is 3.



Example 2:


Input: capacity = [1,2,3,4,5]

Output: 0

Explanation:

No subarray of length at least 3 has equal first and last elements, so the answer is 0.


Example 3:


Input: capacity = [-4,4,0,0,-8,-4]

Output: 1

Explanation:

[-4,4,0,0,-8,-4] is stable because the first and last elements are both -4, and the sum of the elements strictly between them is 4 + 0 + 0 + (-8) = -4


 
Constraints:


	3 <= capacity.length <= 105
	-109 <= capacity[i] <= 109
