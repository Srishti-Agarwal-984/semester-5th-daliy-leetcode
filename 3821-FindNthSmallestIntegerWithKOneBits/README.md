You are given two positive integers n and k.

Return an integer denoting the nth smallest positive integer that has exactly k ones in its binary representation. It is guaranteed that the answer is strictly less than 250.

 
Example 1:


Input: n = 4, k = 2

Output: 9

Explanation:

The 4 smallest positive integers that have exactly k = 2 ones in their binary representations are:


	3 = 112
	5 = 1012
	6 = 1102
	9 = 10012



Example 2:


Input: n = 3, k = 1

Output: 4

Explanation:

The 3 smallest positive integers that have exactly k = 1 one in their binary representations are:


	1 = 12
	2 = 102
	4 = 1002



 
Constraints:


	1 <= n <= 250
	1 <= k <= 50
	The answer is strictly less than 250.
